# Example Projects

In an effort to become more familiarized with other frameworks and languages, I decided to write the same app - a simple Twitter clone - using different languages and frameworks. The app will consist of two separate parts, an API and a Client, and that will allow me to try several different technologies and combinations - Rails api with Angular client / Flask api with React+Redux for example.
